## Design considerations
- use the same 6mm quick release as the palm case
- allow charging with magnetic cable adapter (device should lay into the stand, so the adapter doesn't pull out when the device is removed)
- should be free standing, with sufficient weight and support when placing and removing the device
- future consideration: add a microswitch so actions may be triggered on device placement/removal
